**GenO App** is a cloud-native microservices demo application.
Online Boutique consists of a 10-tier microservices application. The application is a
web-based e-commerce app where users can browse items,
add them to the cart, and purchase them.
---actualizar la peque√±a descripcion de la aplicacion---

**Oracle uses this application to demonstrate use of technologies like
Kubernetes/OKE, Registry/OCIR, Oracle API Gateway, gRPC(API), Skaffold (CI/CD) and Prometheus(monitoring tool)**. This application works on any Kubernetes cluster (such as a local one), as well as Oracle Kubernetes Engine. It‚Äôs **easy to deploy with little to no configuration**.

## Service Architecture

**Online Boutique** is composed of many microservices written in different
languages that talk to each other over gRPC.

## Features

- **[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io)/[OKE](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/compute/container-engine-kubernetes.html):**
  The app is designed to run on Kubernetes (both locally on "Docker for
  Desktop", as well as on the cloud with OKE).
- **[Registry/OCIR](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/compute/container-registry.html):** Private registry for docker images.
- **[gRPC](https://grpc.io):** Microservices use a high volume of gRPC calls to
  communicate to each other.
- **[Skaffold](https://skaffold.dev):** Application
  is deployed to Kubernetes with a single command using Skaffold.
- **[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/):** Open-source monitoring solution.
- **Synthetic Load Generation:** The application demo comes with a background
  job that creates realistic usage patterns on the website using
  [Locust](https://locust.io/) load generator.

## Installation

We offer the following installation methods:

1. **Running locally** (~20 minutes) You will build
   and deploy microservices images to a single-node Kubernetes cluster running on your development machine. There are three options to run a Kubernetes
   cluster locally for this demo:
   - [Minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube). Recommended for Linux hosts (also supports Mac/Windows).
   - [Docker for Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop). Recommended for Mac/Windows.
   - [Kind](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop). Supports Mac/Windows/Linux.

2. **Running on Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE)** (~30 minutes) You will build, upload and deploy the container images to a Kubernetes cluster on Oracle Cloud.

3. **Using pre-built container images:** (~10 minutes, you will still need to
   follow one of the steps above up until `skaffold run` command). With this
   option, you will use pre-built container images that are available publicly,
   instead of building them yourself, which takes a long time).

### Option 2: Running on Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE)

> üí° Recommended if you're using Google Cloud Platform and want to try it on
> a realistic cluster.

1.  Install tools specified in the previous section (Docker, kubectl, skaffold)

1.  Create a Google Kubernetes Engine cluster and make sure `kubectl` is pointing
    to the cluster.

    ```sh
    gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com
    ```

    ```sh
    gcloud container clusters create demo --enable-autoupgrade \
        --enable-autoscaling --min-nodes=3 --max-nodes=10 --num-nodes=5 --zone=us-central1-a
    ```

    ```
    kubectl get nodes
    ```

1.  Enable Google Container Registry (GCR) on your GCP project and configure the
    `docker` CLI to authenticate to GCR:

    ```sh
    gcloud services enable containerregistry.googleapis.com
    ```

    ```sh
    gcloud auth configure-docker -q
    ```

1.  In the root of this repository, run `skaffold run --default-repo=gcr.io/[PROJECT_ID]`,
    where [PROJECT_ID] is your GCP project ID.

    This command:

    - builds the container images
    - pushes them to GCR
    - applies the `./kubernetes-manifests` deploying the application to
      Kubernetes.

    **Troubleshooting:** If you get "No space left on device" error on Google
    Cloud Shell, you can build the images on Google Cloud Build: [Enable the
    Cloud Build
    API](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=cloudbuild.googleapis.com),
    then run `skaffold run -p gcb --default-repo=gcr.io/[PROJECT_ID]` instead.

1.  Find the IP address of your application, then visit the application on your
    browser to confirm installation.

        kubectl get service frontend-external

    **Troubleshooting:** A Kubernetes bug (will be fixed in 1.12) combined with
    a Skaffold [bug](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/skaffold/issues/887)
    causes load balancer to not to work even after getting an IP address. If you
    are seeing this, run `kubectl get service frontend-external -o=yaml | kubectl apply -f-`
    to trigger load balancer reconfiguration.

### Cleanup

If you've deployed the application with `skaffold run` command, you can run
`skaffold delete` to clean up the deployed resources.

If you've deployed the application with `kubectl apply -f [...]`, you can
run `kubectl delete -f [...]` with the same argument to clean up the deployed
resources.
